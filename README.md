A personal web (http://www.dgaubert.com) written with the following technologies:
* [Node](http://nodejs.org/): platform for easily building fast, scalable network applications using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/): web application framework for Node. 
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/): is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database.
* [Mogoose](http://mongoosejs.com/): MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* [Async](http://github.com/caolan/async): Utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

* [Moment](http://github.com/timrwood/moment/): Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in javascript.
* [Feed](http://github.com/jpmonette/feed): RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 generator for Node.js, making content syndication simple, intuitive and performant.
* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/): Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/): Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript. No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework.
* [Should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/): BDD style assertions for node.js -- test framework agnostic.

Mammoth implements the [model of development](https://github.com/dgaubert/mammoth/wiki/Workflow) based on [nvie post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This git branching model has turned out to be very successful.

Javascript is the main language used in Mammoth project. For this reason, I try to follow the Code Conventions for the [JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html), proposed by Douglas Crockford. Furthermore, it's been used style guides like [Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide), [Node.js: Style and structure](http://caolanmcmahon.com/posts/nodejs_style_and_structure/), and [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). When there are conflicts between them, I will follow the Node.js community rule.
