Mammoth implements the [model of development](https://github.com/dgaubert/mammoth/wiki/Workflow) based on [nvie post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This git branching model has turned out to be very successful.

Javascript is the main language used in Mammoth project. For this reason, I try to follow the Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language proposed by Douglas Crockford.
